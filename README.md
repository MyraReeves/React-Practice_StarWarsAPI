# React Practice with StarWarsAPI

This was created in order to practice using more dynamic elements within a React app. It creates a clickable index of Star Wars character cards on the homepage.  When a card is selected, information about that character is displayed on the screen via a request to the [SWAPI website.](https://swapi.dev/)

To-do:  I still need to reduce the amount of code inside the API file.  To eliminate the number of conditionals I'm currently using, I need to instead incorporate additional fetch requests to the other SWAPI urls.
